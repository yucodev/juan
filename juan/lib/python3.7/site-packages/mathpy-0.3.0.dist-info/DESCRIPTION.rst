## About mathpy

mathpy is a collection of mathematical and statistical functions encompassing several different
fields such as linear algebra, numerical analysis, and number theory. The package is intended to
work with other popular scientific computing packages such as numpy and scipy. Most functions in
The mathpy package are also available as Excel UDFs for users who prefer working in Excel. The
mathpy project is primarily a personal project intended to develop a deeper understanding of
the mathematics and algorithmic implementations of various mathematical topics.

## Documentation

The documentation of the mathpy package is available here:

https://aschleg.github.io/mathpy/

The documentation for importing the mathpy functions to use in Excel as UDFs is found here:

https://aschleg.github.io/mathpy/excel.html

## Installation

Mathpy is easily installed through `pip` and is the most recommended approach.

~~~~
pip install mathpy
~~~~

The package should also be able to install from Github with the following command:

~~~~
pip install git+https://github.com/aschleg/mathpy.git
~~~~

The Github repository can also be cloned and installed with the included `setup.py` script.

~~~~
git clone https://github.com/aschleg/mathpy.git
python setup.py install
~~~~
