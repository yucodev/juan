    Notes
    -----
    One-way ANOVA can be considered an extension of the t-test when more than two groups
    are being tested. The factor, or categorical variable, is often referred to as the
    'treatment' in the ANOVA setting. ANOVA involves partitioning the data's total
    variation into variation between and within groups. This procedure is thus known as
    Analysis of Variance as sources of variation are examined separately.

    The data is assumed to be normally distributed with mean :math:`\mu_i` and standard
    deviation :math:`\sigma^2_i`. Stating the hypothesis is also similar to previous
    examples when there were only two samples of interest. The hypothesis can be defined
    formally as:

    :math:`H_O: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \cdots = \mu_k`
    :math:`H_A:` Not all population means are equal

    The one-way ANOVA splits the data's variation into two sources which are in turn used
    to calculate the F-statistic. The F-statistic is determined by the F-test, which is
    done by dividing the variance between groups by the variance within groups. The sum of
    squares for treatments is defined as :math:`SST`, for error as :math:`SSE` and the total
    :math:`TotalSS`. The mean squares are calculated by dividing the sum of squares by the
    degrees of freedom.

    Each sum of squares can be defined as:

    .. math::

        SST = \sum_{i=1}^k n_i(\bar{y_{i}} - \bar{y})^2

    .. math::

        SSE = \sum_{i=1}^k (n_i - 1)s_i^2

    .. math::

        TotalSS = \sum_{i=1}^k \sum_{j=1}^{n_i} (y_{ij} - \bar{y})^2

    The mean squares are the sum of squares divided by the degrees of freedom.

    .. math::

        MST = \frac{SST}{k - 1}

    .. math::

        MSE = \frac{SSE}{n - k}

    The F-statistic is defined as:

    .. math::

        f = \frac{MST}{MSE}

    Notes
    -----
    MANOVA, or Multiple Analysis of Variance, is an extension of Analysis of
    Variance (ANOVA) to several dependent variables. The approach to MANOVA
    is similar to ANOVA in many regards and requires the same assumptions
    (normally distributed dependent variables with equal covariance matrices).

    In the MANOVA setting, each observation vector can have a model denoted as:

    .. math::

        y_{ij} = \mu_i + \epsilon_{ij} \qquad i = 1, 2, \cdots, k; \qquad j = 1, 2, \cdots, n

    An 'observation vector' is a set of observations measured over several variables.
    With :math:`p` variables, :math:`y_{ij}` becomes:

    .. math::

        \begin{bmatrix} y_{ij1} \\ y_{ij2} \\ \vdots \\ y_{ijp} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
        \mu_{i1} \\ \mu_{i2} \\ \vdots \\ \mu_{ip} \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} \epsilon_{ij1}
        \\ \epsilon_{ij2} \\ \vdots \\ \epsilon_{ijp} \end{bmatrix}

    As before in ANOVA, the goal is to compare the groups to see if there are any significant
    differences. However, instead of a single variable, the comparisons will be made with the
    mean vectors of the samples. The null hypothesis :math:`H_0` can be formalized the same
    way in MANOVA:

    .. math::

        H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \dots = \mu_k

    With an alternative hypothesis :math:`H_a` that at least two :math:`\mu` are unequal.
    There are :math:`p(k - 1)`, where :math:`k` is the number of groups in the data,
    equalities that must be true for :math:`H_0` to be accepted.

    Similar to ANOVA, we are interested in partitioning the data's total variation into
    variation between and within groups. In the case of ANOVA, this partitioning is done
    by calculating :math:`SSH` and :math:`SSE`; however, in the multivariate case, we must
    extend this to encompass the variation in all the :math:`p` variables. Therefore, we
    must compute the between and within sum of squares for each possible comparison. This
    procedure results in the :math:`H` "hypothesis matrix" and :math:`E` "error matrix."

    The :math:`H` matrix is a square :math:`p \times p` with the form:

    .. math::

        H = \begin{bmatrix} SSH_{11} & SPH_{21} & \dots & SPH_{1p} \\
        SPH_{12} & SSH_{22} & \dots & SPH_{2p} \\ \vdots & \vdots & & \vdots \\
        SPH_{1p} & SPH_{2p} & \cdots & SSH_{pp} \end{bmatrix}

    The error matrix :math:`E` is also :math:`p \times p`

    .. math::

        E = \begin{bmatrix} SSE_{11} & SPE_{12} & \cdots & SPE_{1p} \\
        SPE_{12} & SSE_{22} & \cdots & SPE_{2p} \\ \vdots & \vdots & & \vdots \\
        SPE_{1p} & SPE_{2p} & \cdots & SSE_{pp} \end{bmatrix}

    Once the :math:`H` and :math:`E` matrices are constructed, the mean vectors can be
    compared to determine if significant differences exist. There are several test
    statistics, of which the most common are Wilk's lambda, Roy's test, Pillai, and
    Lawley-Hotelling, that can be employed to test for significant differences. Each test
    statistic has specific properties and power.

    Multiple tests of significance can be employed when performing MANOVA. The
    most well known and widely used MANOVA test statistics are Wilk's :math:`\Lambda`,
    Pillai, Lawley-Hotelling, and Roy's test. Unlike ANOVA, in which only one
    dependent variable is examined, several tests are often utilized in MANOVA
    due to its multidimensional nature. Each MANOVA test statistic is different
    and can lead to different conclusions depending on how the data and mean vectors lie.

    The Pillai test statistic is denoted as :math:`V^{(s)}` and defined as:

    .. math::

        V^{(s)} = tr[(E + H0)^{-1} H] = \sum^s_{i=1} \frac{\lambda_i}{1 + \lambda_i}

    Where :math:`\lambda_i` represents the :math:`i`th nonzero eigenvalue of
    :math:`E^{-1}H`.

    The critical Pillai value is found by computing :math:`s`, :math:`m`, and :math:`N`
    which are also employed in Roy's test (the Pillai test is an extension of Roy's
    test). The values are defined as:

    .. math::

        s = min(p, V_h) \qquad m = \frac{1}{2} (\left| V_h - p \right| - 1) \qquad N = \frac{1}{2} (V_E - p - 1)

    An approximate F-statistic can be found with the following equation:

    .. math::

        F = \frac{(2N + s + 1)V^{(s)}}{(2m + s + 1)(s - V^{(s)})}

    Wilk's :math:`\Lambda`, one of the more commonly used MANOVA test statistics,
    compares the :math:`E` matrix to the total :math:`E + H` matrix. Wilk's
    :math:`\Lambda` is calculated using the determinants of those two matrices.

    .. math::

        \Lambda = \frac{\left| E \right|}{\left| E + H \right|}

    Wilk's :math:`\Lambda` can also be written in terms of the :math:`E^{-1}H`
    eigenvalues :math:`(\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \cdots, \lambda_s)`.

    .. math::

        \Lambda = \prod^s_{i=1} \frac{1}{1 + \lambda_i}

    An approximate F-Value can be calculated using Wilk's Lambda:

    .. math::

        F = \frac{1 - \Lambda^{(1/t)}}{\Lambda^{(1/t)}} \frac{df_2}{df_1}

    Where

    .. math::

        df_1 = pv_H, \qquad df_2 = wt - \frac{1}{2}(pv_H - 2), \qquad w = v_E + v_H - \frac{1}{2}(p + v_H + 1)

    .. math::

        t = \sqrt{\frac{p^2v^2_H - 4}{p^2 + v^2_H - 5}}

    The Lawley-Hotelling statistic, also known as Hotelling's generalized :math:`T^2`-statistic,
    is denoted :math:`U^{(s)}` and is defined as:

    .. math::

        U^{(s)} = tr(E^{-1}H) = \sum^s_{i=1} \lambda_i

    The approximate F-statistic in the Lawley-Hotelling setting is defined as:

    .. math::

        F = \frac{2 (sN + 1)U^{(s)}}{s^2(2m + s + 1)}

    Where :math:`s`, :math:`m`, and :math`N` are defined as above.

    Roy's test statistic is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix :math:`E^{-1}H`

    The F-statistic in Roy's setting can be computed as:

    .. math::

        \frac{k(n - 1)}{k - 1} \lambda_1
